## Salutation! ðŸ––

I'm a **cybersecurity student** at **BeCode**, passionate about exploring new **_technologies_** and tools to enhance daily life, boost **_productivity_**, and strengthen **_security_**. I love **_learning_** and **_experimenting_**. 

With a background in **psychology** and a strong interest in **coding** and **cryptography**, I offer a unique perspective to cybersecurity, particularly in understanding **human behavior** and **social engineering** threats. 

Currently, I am also undertaking an online [Stanford University **cryptography** class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto/home), cultivating my interest in mathematics and algorithms.
